In [Hypixel SkyBlock](https://wiki.hypixel.net/Main_Page), a common question to hear in-game is: _"Is it profitable to re-roll this dungeon chest?"_

Since the cost to re-roll and the profit obtained from a dungeon chest are both based on the market, the answer to this question changes frequently.
This is why I created a tool that fetches market prices, calculates an expected value based on the posted drop rates of various items in the loot table,
and presents the user with a simple, definitive answer.

This project has two subprojects:

- The **extractor** is a Node.js script that fetches SkyBlock Wiki pages, parses their HTML content, and converts the set of tabs and tables into a JSON file.
- The **website** is a Next.js site which uses the data file generated by the extractor and auction price data from Tricked's lowestbins to calculate expected value per run and whether it is worth the cost to reroll chests.
