**Pitch Labs** is a nonprofit dedicated to providing the resources necessary for anyone to start and run a business. They host [events](https://www.pitchlabs.org/events), publish [articles](https://www.pitchlabs.org/library), and run an online [community](https://www.pitchlabs.org/discord) of current and prospective entrepreneurs.

I work on the web development team, where I maintain and build new features in our Next.js 14 (`app` directory) codebase.

We use [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) as a headless CMS for the article library, user authentication, and content on a few pages that need updating by other team members.

I built the organization's internal dashboard application using [Refine](https://refine.dev) with Next.js for routing, Ant Design for UI components, and Strapi as the backend.
