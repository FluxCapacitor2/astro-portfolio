- Originally designed as a single-page app made with Vue.js; rewritten with Svelte and SvelteKit for its static site generation capabilities.
  - See the [old GitHub repository](https://github.com/FluxCapacitor2/WebQuiz-Vue) or a [live version](https://webquiz-vue.bswanson.dev)
- Recommended by one of Green Hope's AP Environmental Science teachers as the best way to study for in-class exams.
- Includes quizzes with questions from multiple chapters and a final review quiz which includes all questions from every quiz.
- Responses are saved in `localStorage`, so user progress isn't lost when reloading the page.
- Quizzes look beautiful when printed.
